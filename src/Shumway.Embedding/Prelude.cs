/// Internal Prolog prelude that <see cref="PrologEngine"/> consults at
/// construction time. Lives in a private module so its predicates are
/// declared <c>:- public</c> from the prelude's perspective but never
/// collide with user code, and are not subject to module-aware mangling
/// the same way user-defined locals are.
///
/// <para>The prelude is the home for predicates that benefit from
/// Prolog-level backtracking: <c>member/2</c>, <c>clause/2</c>, and
/// <c>current_predicate/1</c> all enumerate solutions, so they're far
/// nicer expressed as a pair of clauses than as a builtin that has to
/// fake backtracking. The Prolog-level definitions ride the standard
/// WAM choice-point machinery without any builtin-CP plumbing.</para>
///
/// <para>The C# side keeps a couple of "all matches" helper builtins
/// (<c>'$all_clauses_of'/2</c>, <c>'$all_predicate_indicators'/1</c>)
/// that bridge from the engine's clause and functor tables into a
/// Prolog list — Prolog's <c>member/2</c> then enumerates the list
/// with normal backtracking.</para>
